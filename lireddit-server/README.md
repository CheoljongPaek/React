### Day 1

1. *yarn* is used to block the possibility to install packages in duplicate which can be problematic if there are many files.
2. *types/node* is a type information for built-in node fuction.
3. *ts-node* to run typescript file by transpiling typescript in memory.
4. *npx tsconfig.json* to build typescript configuration file called tsconfig.json. I chose *node* for backend.
> *ts-node* is slow ...
